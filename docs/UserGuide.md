Harmonia is a **desktop app for managing tasks related to your academic life, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Harmonia can get your task management done faster than traditional GUI-based task managers. Harmonia is built by students, for students. With firsthand experience of what a student experiences, we seek to simplify the complexity associated with your academic and non-academic life.

## 3. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Notes about the command format:**

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Complete Tutorial`.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `find [n/NAME] [t/TAG]` can be used as `find n/Complete Tutorial` or `find t/CS203T`.

- Items followed by `...` can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `t/CS2103T t/Tutorial`.

- [`Index`](#52-index) refers to the numbering of an item as shown in the displayed task list.<br>

  e.g. in a list of tasks:<br>
       1. Do homework<br>
       2. Clean room<br>
       3. Walk dog<br>
       Index 2 here refers to the second item in the list, "Clean room".

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in any parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if you input `exit 123`, Harmonia will interpret it as `exit`.

</div>

Format: `find [n/NAME_KEYWORD]... [d/DESCRIPTION_KEYWORD]... [start/START_DATE] [end/END_DATE] [p/PRIORITY]... [t/TAG]... [c/COMPLETION_STATUS]`

* If a `NAME_KEYWORD` is supplied by you, Harmonia finds the tasks whose name contains the `NAME_KEYWORD` specified. If multiple `NAME_KEYWORD`s are supplied by you, Harmonia finds the tasks whose name contains any of the `NAME_KEYWORD`s supplied.

* If a `DESCRIPTION_KEYWORD` is supplied by you, Harmonia finds the tasks whose description contains the `DESCRIPTION_KEYWORD` specified. If multiple `DESCRIPTION_KEYWORD`s are supplied by you, Harmonia finds the tasks whose description contains any of the `DESCRIPTION_KEYWORD`s supplied.

* If both `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` are supplied by you, Harmonia finds the tasks whose deadline is between the `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` inclusive.

* If only one of either `START_DATE` or `END_DATE` is supplied by you, Harmonia ignores the unspecified field. For example, if only `START_DATE` is supplied by you, Harmonia finds all the tasks with a deadline that is after and including `START_DATE`.

* If a `PRIORITY` is supplied by you, Harmonia finds the tasks whose priority matches the `PRIORITY` supplied by you. If multiple values of `PRIORITY` are supplied by you, Harmonia finds the tasks whose priority matches any of the values of `PRIORITY` supplied.

* If a `TAG` is supplied by you, Harmonia finds tasks whose [tag(s)](#53-tag) match the `TAG` specified. If multiple `TAG`s are supplied by you, Harmonia finds the tasks whose tag(s) match any of the `TAG`s supplied.

* If a `COMPLETION_STATUS` is supplied by you, Harmonia finds tasks that match the `COMPLETION_STATUS` specified. Completion status can be either `true` or `false`.

Example: `find n/tp n/CS2103T t/meeting start/2022-03-15 end/2022-03-27 p/low p/medium c/true`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Note:**
You can also search using multiple descriptors (e.g. `find n/book t/CS2103T`) to narrow down your search.

## 5. Glossary

### 5.1 JSON file

[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values). [(Source: Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)

In Harmonia, a JSON file is used to store the list of tasks. For each task, the JSON file stores the mapping between attributes (e.g. task name, description, etc.) and their values. If you are an advanced user, you may choose to update the data by editing the JSON file.

[Return to Top](#table-of-contents-toc)

### 5.2 Index

Harmonia uses indexes to help you address a task easily. An `Index` refers to the numbering of an item in a list, as shown in the displayed task list.<br>

For example,  in a list of tasks:<br>
1. Do homework<br>
2. Clean room<br>
3. Walk dog<br>
Index 2 here refers to the second item in the list, "Clean room".

[Return to Top](#table-of-contents-toc)

### 5.3 Tag

Harmonia uses tags to help you categorize your tasks. You may optionally assign one or more tags to a task through [Adding a task: add](#31-adding-a-task-add), and find your tasks with specified tag(s) through [Locating a task: find](#35-locating-a-task-find).

[Return to Top](#table-of-contents-toc)

### 5.4 GUI

The graphical user interface (GUI) is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. [(Source: Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)

Harmonia uses a simple GUI to help you interact with the application, while preserving the benefits of command line interface (CLI).
